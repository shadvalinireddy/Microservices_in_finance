# Microservices Evolution in Finance System
This project highlights the transition from monolithic to microservices architecture in financial services.
- **Account Service**: Manages accounts.
- **Loan Service**: Handles loan processing.
- **Insurance Service**: Manages insurance policies.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications.
- **Transaction Service**: Manages transactions.

Abstract:

Facing the limitations of traditional monolithic architectures in financial applications, this project seeks to modernize by transitioning to a microservices-based approach. Recognizing drawbacks such as limited scalability, difficulty in introducing new features, and potential single points of failure, the project aims to address these challenges. Specifically, it targets key modules such as account management, transaction processing, and reporting, aiming to improve their flexibility, scalability, and resilience. Through the adoption of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end, for the back-end, the project ensures agility in development. The MongoDB for the database caters to diverse data management needs. By embracing a microservices architecture, the project intends to break down monolithic systems into independent services, facilitating rapid development and deployment. This strategic shift empowers financial institutions to promptly adapt to market dynamics, enhance customer experiences, and maintain competitiveness. Through the efficient integration of technology, the project endeavors to facilitate a seamless transition into the digital era, ensuring a robust and future-proof foundation for financial applications.

Overview of Microservices in Financial Applications: 

Financial services are rapidly adopting digital technologies to meet new user demands and compete in a digital-first world. Traditional systems struggle to adapt to the pace of innovation.

Problem Statement: 

Existing monolithic financial applications are difficult to scale, costly to update, and inefficient in supporting modern financial operations. They lack flexibility for fast updates and integration with new services.

Solution: 

Microservices provide a modular approach that breaks down applications into loosely coupled services. Each service can be updated, deployed, and scaled independently, meeting the needs of a digital, customer-centric financial environment.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:

Backend:

MongoDB: A flexible, document-oriented NoSQL database, ideal for managing the dynamic and varied data generated by financial services.
Thunder Client: Used for efficient API testing, particularly during development, ensuring each service's endpoints function as expected.

Frontend:

HTML and CSS: Core technologies for building a responsive, visually engaging user interface that supports both web and mobile-friendly design.

Frontend-Backend Communication:

CORS Library: Used to enable secure cross-origin communication between the frontend and backend.

Messaging and Integration:

RabbitMQ: Central to inter-service messaging, allowing asynchronous, reliable communication between services.
